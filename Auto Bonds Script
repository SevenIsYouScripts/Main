My idea is to create a script with several functions such as Esp, KillAura, Teleport, Bring Items, Bypass Fly, Auto Reload, Auto Shoot, Auto Sell... and many other things. It will take a few weeks to release this update because im making my scripts in mobile i dont have pc, but I want this update to be a big update. I'm counting on your patience. I'll be back soon.\nSigned: BlankX :)"
